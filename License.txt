**Adaption and Modification -- It means you can do anything with this piece of software. The developer cannot retain the freedom.
**Distribution -- Direct distributions aren't allowed. Distribute it like however you want, but decent modifications should be made so that it doesn't look like a garbage clone.

Credit isn't mandatory but appreciated.
